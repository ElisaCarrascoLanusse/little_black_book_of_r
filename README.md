# learning-r
 
The Little Black Book of R is meant to be a reference companion for both beginners in R and more advanced users. The guide mainly consists of different functions, packages, and uses along with brief notes on them. This is a project I have taken up in my own journey to learn R and much of this knowledge comes from Dr. Escandell's class and R for Data Science.

Hope it helps, let me know if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions!!
